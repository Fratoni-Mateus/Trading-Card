				<p>As a flightless bird, the greater rhea is capable of running at speeds
				of 60 km/h and can grow up to 1.7 meters tall. Famous for their long
				and slim neck and legs, alongside with their round bodies with gray
				feathers, make it a very peculiar bird in the South-american region.</p>
